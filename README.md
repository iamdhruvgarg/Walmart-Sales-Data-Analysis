## üéØ Objectives
- Identify high-performing branches and products.
- Analyze sales trends across different product lines.
- Understand customer behavior and preferences.
- Optimize sales strategies using data-driven insights.

## üîç Analysis Performed

### üè™ Branch & Sales Analysis
- Identify **top-performing branches** based on total sales and profit.
- Find the **city with the highest revenue**.
- Analyze **sales trends across different months**.

### üìä Product Analysis
- Identify the **best-selling product line**.
- Determine the **most profitable product category**.
- Compare **product sales based on customer gender**.

### üë• Customer Analysis
- Identify the **most common customer type**.
- Analyze **which customer type generates the most revenue**.
- Determine **the preferred payment method**.
- Find out **which day of the week has the most purchases**.

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Approach & Implementation
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Remove null values and duplicates.
- Format date and time for better analysis.
- Create additional time-based columns (`time_of_day`, `day_name`, `month_name`).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Use **GROUP BY** to analyze sales trends per branch and product line.
- Use **JOINS** for deeper insights into customer behavior.
- Apply **aggregate functions** (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) to summarize key metrics.

## üìà Revenue & Profit Calculation
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** `COGS = unit_price * quantity`
- **VAT Calculation:** `VAT = 5% * COGS`
- **Total Sales Amount:** `total = COGS + VAT`
- **Gross Income:** `gross_income = total - COGS`
- **Gross Margin %:** `gross_margin_pct = (gross_income / total) * 100`
